# FER Webshop

This project contains a simple web-shop like page that demonstrates the usage of Spring with Angular 2. Users can navigate the page, browse the web shop items, place items in a cart, register and sign in. For the sake of simplicity and since this is just a demo project focusing on interaction between Spring and Angular 2, the username and e-mail provided during registration are not checked for uniqueness and passwords are not hashed. My project Moghi Battles demonstrates how to hash the user's password during registration.
